/**
 * effective_config pi tool (#2427) — the in-process half of
 * `pilens_effective_config`.
 *
 * A thin wrapper over the `effectiveConfig()` engine seam
 * (`clients/lens-engine.ts`), like `tools/symbol-search.ts` over
 * `symbolSearch()`: the payload is byte-identical to the MCP mirror's because
 * both render the SAME view object, and neither adapter shapes it. The whole
 * reason the capability is an engine method rather than an MCP handler is that
 * a second projection would be a second chance to disagree about which server
 * is running.
