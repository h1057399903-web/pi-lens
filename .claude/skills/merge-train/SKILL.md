# Merge train

The policy that landed the 2026-08-17 arc (11 PRs, every one adversarially
reviewed, zero unreviewed merges). Apply it to each PR in the queue.

## The loop, per PR

1. **Review.** Spawn `pi-lens-reviewer` (worktree isolation) with the PR
   number, a one-paragraph summary of the claim, and any PR-specific attack
   angles. Self-authored and small PRs get reviewed too — no exceptions.
2. **Fix rounds.** Send findings back to the PR's original author agent when
   its worktree survives (SendMessage — cheapest context); otherwise spawn
   `pi-lens-fixer` on the branch with the findings inlined.
   **Since #2486, `SubagentStop` REAPS the stopped agent's own worktree**
   (maintainer decision, 2026-09-02, reversing the earlier "never removes
   here" rule, which left ten stale trees in one afternoon). So by default an
   agent's tree is gone the moment it finishes, and SendMessage to it lands on
   a branch with no checkout. Its branch survives — a tree is never removed
   unless its HEAD is already in an `origin/*` ref — so nothing committed is
   lost and a fresh `pi-lens-fixer` on the branch always works. If this
   session intends to resume fixers by SendMessage, export
   `PILENS_HYGIENE_KEEP_AGENT_TREES=1` for the session (or add
   `--keep-agent-tree` to the registered hook) and the reap is off.
   Kept trees are then reaped by the `SessionStart` sweep —
   which runs on `startup` and `resume` only, not on `/clear`, compaction or a
   fork — once they have been idle ≥30m and are clean and pushed. Idle is
   measured from the checkout directory and the worktree's HEAD (and its
   reflog), never from the git index, so the sweep's own dirty check cannot
   make a finished tree look busy.
   A tree with uncommitted work, or with work not yet on an `origin/*` ref, is
   never removed at any age, by any sweep — so a fix round in flight is safe by
   its own state, not by the clock.
3. **Verify.** The SAME reviewer verifies each fix round with its own probes.
   Do not take the fixer's word; do not swap reviewers mid-PR. A reviewer's
   worktree is an `agent-*` tree too, so once its report lands the tree is
   clean+pushed and `SubagentStop` reaps it exactly like a fixer's — a
   SendMessage resume finds no checkout, same as above. Recreate it: the
   merge-train practice is a FRESH reviewer worktree per VERIFY round, not a
   kept one. Continuity is the reviewer AGENT (SendMessage still reaches the
   same identity, so the same judgment and probes carry over); the checkout
   under it is expected to be rebuilt each round, not preserved. Do not set
   `--keep-agent-tree` / `PILENS_HYGIENE_KEEP_AGENT_TREES=1` merely to dodge
   this — that decision stays off by default (see step 2).
4. **Merge gate.** Merge only when: verdict is merge-ready; Unit tests and
   Lint genuinely EXECUTED and passed on the exact head SHA (read check-runs —
   a DIRTY PR silently skips them, absent is not green); every failing check
   was read and judged (infra failures — codeload 429/503, SARIF-upload
   errors, Initialize-CodeQL outages — may be waved through only with the
   log read and the judgment recorded).
5. **Merge.** `gh pr merge <N> --merge` (merge commit, repo convention).
   If "not up to date", `gh api -X PUT .../pulls/<N>/update-branch`, wait for
   CI, re-gate, merge. On GitHub 503s: retry with backoff, never switch to
   raw-API merge endpoints.
   Alternative, once the verdict is in: apply the `train:approved` label (add
   `train:squash` for a squash merge) and let the merge-train lane workflow
   land it (#2185). The lane merges only when both required checks have
   CONCLUDED success on the exact current head, so a fix round pushed after
   labeling re-gates itself. Removing the label aborts. Steps 1 through 4 are
   unchanged: only the maintainer applies the label, and only after the
   review verdict.
6. **After each merge.** Master moved: check other open PRs for BEHIND/DIRTY,
   check in-flight agents for file overlap with the merged diff and nudge
   affected ones to merge origin/master before their next push.

## Queue ordering

Order by dependency, not age: a PR whose schema/API another PR must consume
merges first (the consumer then rebases and wires the new surface). Two PRs
editing the same file get an explicit order decided up front. Log-schema
changes must extend exact-key pins (`BASELINE_KEYS`-style), never loosen them.

## Honesty rules

- A finding is real when a probe proves it; a fix is real when the same probe
  passes and the regression test was red first.
- `closes` vs `refs` follows delivery, not optimism; leftovers get an issue
  comment before anything closes.
- After merging a `refs #N` PR, VERIFY the issue: read `gh issue view N
  --comments` and confirm a comment names the remainder. If the PR in fact
  satisfied every acceptance criterion, close N crediting the PR; if a
  remainder exists but is unnamed, post it. A `refs` PR with no remainder
  comment is how #1968 and #2355 sat open for weeks after their fixes
  landed (found 2026-09-02).
- Report what ran, what was skipped, and what CI must still confirm.
