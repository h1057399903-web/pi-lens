/**
 * WHERE pi-lens config lives, and in what order (#2426).
 *
 * Before this module the answer was spread across three loaders with three
 * different walks: `lsp/config.ts` had its own `CONFIG_PATHS` and an UNBOUNDED
 * upward walk to the filesystem root, `project-lens-config.ts` had its own
 * `PROJECT_CONFIG_BASENAMES` and a second unbounded walk, and `lens-config.ts`
 * read one fixed path. Three walks meant three places for the #622/#625
 * ceiling rule to be forgotten, and it was: a `pi-lsp.json` sitting in `$HOME`
 * — or in `C:\` — was read for every project on the machine.
 *
 * There are exactly TWO canonical locations:
 *
 *   `.pi-lens.json`            — project, nearest-package-wins per field
 *   `~/.pi-lens/config.json`   — machine-global
 *
 * Everything else in `PROJECT_CONFIG_LOCATIONS` / `GLOBAL_CONFIG_LOCATIONS` is
 * legacy, read for the deprecation window declared in
 * `DEPRECATED_CONFIG_SURFACES` and then removed. This module does not restate
 * that membership: it DERIVES the legacy set from the registry and orders it,
 * and `tests/clients/config-locations.test.ts` pins that the derived set is
 * exactly the registry's `kind: "file"` rows. Registry owns WHICH surfaces are
 * deprecated; this module owns only their precedence.
 *
 * Pure data plus one walk. No file reads, no caching, no state.
