/**
 * LSP Configuration for pi-lens
 *
 * Allows users to define custom LSP servers and override initialization options
 * for built-in servers via configuration.
 *
 * CANONICAL LOCATION (#2426): the `lsp` namespace of `.pi-lens.json` (project)
 * and `~/.pi-lens/config.json` (machine-global). `.pi-lens/lsp.json`,
 * `pi-lsp.json` and `~/.pi-lens/lsp.json` — and the four LSP keys at the ROOT
 * of a canonical file — are still read for their deprecation window
 * (`DEPRECATED_CONFIG_SURFACES`) and emit one migration warning per
 * `(file, key)` naming where the setting moves. The canonical spelling wins
 * every collision. `docs/configuration.md` documents the full lookup order;
 * discovery itself lives in `clients/config-resolve.ts`, which this module and
 * the other two loaders now share.
 *
 * Example — custom server (canonical spelling, inside `.pi-lens.json`):
 * {
 *   "lsp": {
 *     "servers": {
 *       "my-server": {
 *         "name": "My Custom LSP",
 *         "extensions": [".myext"],
 *         "command": "my-lsp-server",
 *         "args": ["--stdio"],
 *         "rootMarkers": ["package.json"]
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * Example — override initializationOptions for a built-in server:
 * {
 *   "lsp": {
 *     "serverOverrides": {
 *       "rust": {
 *         "initializationOptions": {
 *           "check": { "command": "clippy", "allTargets": true },
 *           "cargo": { "features": "all", "targetDir": true }
 *         }
 *       },
 *       "nix": {
 *         "initializationOptions": {
 *           "nixpkgs": { "expr": "import <nixpkgs> {}" }
 *         }
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * The `initializationOptions` object is deep-merged onto the server's built-in
 * defaults, so you only need to specify the keys you want to change or add.
 * User-supplied values win on conflicts at every level of nesting.
 *
 * Server IDs match the `id` field of each built-in server definition in
 * clients/lsp/server.ts (e.g. "rust", "nix", "bash", "python", "go", "ts").

 * Load LSP configuration — a PROJECTION of the one resolved pi-lens config.
 *
 * Everything that used to be here (the candidate list, the unbounded upward
 * walk, the two-object merge with its four hand-patched keys) now lives in
 * `config-resolve.ts` and applies identically to the other two loaders. What is
 * left is the projection: pick the `lsp` section out of the resolved value and
 * shape it into `LSPConfig`.
 *
 * Three behaviors changed with the move, all of them deliberate and all of them
 * pinned by `tests/clients/config-golden-layouts.test.ts`:
 *
 * 1. THE WALK IS CEILING-BOUNDED. It used to run to the filesystem root with no
 *    `$HOME` stop, so a `pi-lsp.json` in the user's home directory was adopted
 *    by every project on the machine (#622/#625's class, and #2426's one
 *    outright bug fix rather than deprecation).
 * 2. THE CANONICAL FILE WINS. `.pi-lens.json` used to LOSE to a leftover
 *    `.pi-lens/lsp.json` in the same directory, which made the migration users
 *    are now being asked to perform impossible to complete.
 * 3. NESTED CONFIGS LAYER instead of the nearest one winning wholesale, which
 *    is the same nearest-wins-per-field rule `.pi-lens.json`'s `ignore` has had
 *    since #783.
 *
 * `homeDir` is a test seam only, matching `findNestedProjectMutationValue`'s.
 *
 * `report: false` performs the same resolution and returns the same config
 * WITHOUT firing a user-facing notice (#2427 review round 2, F6). It exists for
 * `effectiveConfig`, whose whole contract is that asking what your
 * configuration is must not warn you about it or consume the warn-once latch
 * that the session-start load needs. Suppressing means suppressing BOTH sinks —
 * the record report and the per-document read-failure report — because a
 * question that answers "your global config is unreadable" by emitting the
 * loader's own degradation notice has reported all the same.
 *
 * It lives HERE and only here. `initLSPConfig` used to take the same option so
 * that `effectiveConfig` could initialize a workspace quietly; round 3 removed
 * that call outright, which removed the option, the parallel "which run is
 * silent" set beside `configInFlight`, and the reporting-caller-never-joins-a-
 * silent-run rule the two of them needed.
