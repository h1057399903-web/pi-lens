	// cells. Clearing it would show the fact in the first session's
	// `pilens_health` and hide it from every session after, which is exactly
	// when someone reads that line. The row is bounded independently of the
	// session (one entry per family, capped at 16), so leaving it costs a fixed
	// handful of lines and keeps a process-scope fact visible for the process's
	// life. Deliberate exception to catalog shape 17, not an oversight.
	//
	// `getProbeHomeRedirectEvent()` (#2506) is the same shape as the
	// process-singleton case above and for the same reason: the redirect is
	// resolved at most once per PROCESS (memoized in the `globalThis` slot
	// `probe-home-state.ts` owns, not a session-scoped one), so it cannot
	// recur within this process's life either — clearing it here would hide
	// the fact from every session after the first in the same probe process.
