/**
 * The ONE config resolution path (#2426).
 *
 * Every pi-lens config file — canonical or legacy, project or global — is read,
 * validated and layered here, through `config-core`'s `resolveConfig` over the
 * canonical schema in `config-schema.ts`. The three exported loaders
 * (`loadLSPConfig`, `loadPiLensGlobalConfig`, `loadPiLensProjectConfig`) keep
 * their names and return types and become PROJECTIONS of what this module
 * resolves, so their ~20 call sites are untouched.
 *
 * THE DOCUMENTED LOOKUP ORDER, lowest precedence first:
 *
 *   builtin -> global -> project root -> nested-project -> env -> cli -> host
 *
 * It is `config-core`'s own `TIER_PRECEDENCE`, not a second ordering: this
 * module places files into tiers and the core sorts them. `docs/configuration.md`
 * documents the same order once, and `tests/clients/config-resolve.test.ts`
 * walks it.
 *
 * Only THREE of those tiers are populated here — `global`, `project` and
 * `nested-project` — because those are the tiers config FILES live in.
 * `builtin`, `env`, `cli` and `host` are reserved (#2427 wires env/CLI, #2416
 * the host tier); today's env vars and CLI flags reach a setting through their
 * own accessors, and `docs/configuration.md` states that precedence rather than
 * implying this resolution already carries it.
 *
 * WITHIN a tier, the canonical file is added LAST and therefore wins, because
 * `merge` keeps caller order on a precedence tie. That is the whole deprecation
 * story in one line: a legacy file is still read, and it loses to the file the
 * user is being told to move to.
 *
 * NO COMPAT REWRITING HAPPENS TO A VALUE. An earlier draft normalized legacy
 * root keys into the `lsp` namespace before merging, which would have injected
 * an `lsp` key into `PiLensProjectConfig.raw` that was never in the user's file.
 * Instead the legacy root keys stay where they are, are merged as themselves,
 * and `lspSectionOf` below combines them with the canonical `lsp` namespace at
 * PROJECTION time, canonical winning. The value a projection reads is therefore
 * always a value some file actually contained.

 * session 2 onwards. And the count is bounded: the number of these a file can
 * produce is the number of keys the user typed — a 100-key file emitted 98
 * unknown-key notifications — so the buffered list goes through the same
 * `finalizeRecords` bound every other config record obeys, with one slot held
 * back to say how many were suppressed.
 *
 * ONE COPY, in the module both loaders already import (#2426 review round 7,
 * F2). Round 6 gave the global loader the bound the project loader already had
 * — by copying it — leaving two spellings of one record literal
 * (`PILENS_CFG_0001`, no key, `migrationSubject(configPath, "")`) and one flush,
 * differing only in a tier literal. Two copies of one policy is the shape round
 * 5 collapsed three copies of this same bound to avoid, so the tier is an
 * argument and the copy is gone. `tests/clients/config-notice-bounds.test.ts`
 * asserts on the SOURCE that no third copy grows back, because duplication is
 * invisible to a behavioral probe until one copy is edited.
 *
 * The buffer is a plain array (round 6, S2). It used to be a pre-subtracted
 * `finalizableCollector`, a second exported shape for the one policy round 5
 * had just collapsed; the notes a single parse can accumulate are bounded by
 * the document already in memory, which is a smaller cost than a second public
 * entry point onto the same arithmetic.
