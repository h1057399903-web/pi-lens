/**
 * #2442: forbid a NEW hand-rolled evict-oldest block outside
 * `clients/bounded-cache.ts`.
 *
 * `clients/bounded-cache.ts` ships two small bounded collections —
 * `BoundedLruCache` (get() re-inserts) and `BoundedFifoMap` (get() never
 * re-inserts, insertion-order eviction) — built specifically so a call site
 * never has to hand-roll `const oldest = map.keys().next().value; if
 * (oldest !== undefined) map.delete(oldest);` again. #2432's round-3 review
 * named two such hand-rolled sites (`clients/hashline-anchor.ts`,
 * `clients/mutating-tool.ts`); a repo-wide sweep found the idiom 27 times.
 *
 * ## Two properties this sweep learned the hard way (#2442 review F5/F6)
 *
 * 1. **Three spellings, not one.** The first draft matched only
 *    `.keys().next().value`, so `tree-sitter-client.ts`'s two live
 *    `.entries().next().value` evictions and `debug-handles.ts`'s
 *    `for (const k of map.keys()) { …; break }` walk were invisible to a guard
 *    whose whole job was finding them. All three spellings are matched now,
 *    across `keys`/`values`/`entries` — the Set-shaped sites use `.values()`.
 * 2. **Per-OCCURRENCE, not per-FILE.** Exemptions used to name a file, so a
 *    NEW hand-rolled eviction appended to an already-exempted file passed
 *    silently — the exemption laundered it. Every flagged item is now keyed
 *    by `stableOccurrenceKey` (`tests/support/sweep-kit.ts`), so an exemption
 *    is supposed to excuse exactly one occurrence and nothing else — but the
 *    key alone cannot fully guarantee that: in a class-shaped file, every
 *    method's flagged line resolves to the SAME enclosing symbol (the class
 *    name), so two sibling methods that each flag a byte-identical line
 *    collide on one key, and one exemption would silently excuse both (#2487
 *    review F1 — the exact laundering this property exists to prevent, one
 *    layer down). `auditRegistry`'s `requireUniqueFlagged` (on by default)
 *    is what actually closes that: a duplicate flagged key fails LOUD before
 *    exemption-matching ever runs, so a real collision cannot ride through
 *    silently regardless of how the key was derived.
 * 3. **Content-keyed, not line-keyed (#2475).** The first version of property
 *    2 keyed on `path:line`, which re-keys on every unrelated line inserted
 *    ABOVE a flagged site — #2459, #2449, and #2474 each had to re-pin a line
 *    number that had nothing to do with their own change, and a textual merge
 *    of two such re-keys can silently land a WRONG number with no conflict
 *    marker. `stableOccurrenceKey` keys on the occurrence's own TEXT instead
 *    (its enclosing top-level declaration name, via `findEnclosingSymbol`,
 *    plus a short content hash of the flagged line via `lineContentHash`), so
 *    moving the site by inserting lines elsewhere in the file is a no-op for
 *    the key. Deleting or editing the flagged line still changes its key —
 *    correctly, since `auditRegistry`'s stale-exemption check must still
 *    catch an exemption whose target moved or vanished; it now reports the
 *    drift by name/hash instead of by line number.
 *
 * Built on tests/support/sweep-kit.ts, same as this repo's other
 * registered-or-fail sweeps. `EXEMPT_SITES` below is the FULL, reasoned list
 * of every remaining occurrence. A NEW site must migrate to `BoundedLruCache`
 * or `BoundedFifoMap`, or be added here with a real reason.
