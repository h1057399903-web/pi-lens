/**
 * #1980 AC3, as a recurrence guard rather than a one-off census.
 *
 * A synchronous child-process call parks the event loop for exactly as long
 * as the child takes. With no `timeout`, that park is unbounded — and #1980's
 * whole finding is that such a park used to read as ordinary compute in
 * `loop_block`, because `windowCpuMs` was recorded beside every block and
 * never read.
 *
 * The one-off sweep found three real call sites with no bound. Two are fixed
 * (`findBinaryOnPath` in clients/lsp/launch.ts, on the LSP spawn path;
 * `ensureUtf8ConsoleCodePageOnce` in clients/safe-spawn.ts, on the first spawn
 * of the process); the third is exempted below with its reason. This walks the
 * family so the next one cannot land silently: a hand-written list of "the
 * sync spawn sites" goes stale the first time someone adds one, which is the
 * single-source-of-truth rule this repo already applies to language and runner
 * registries.
 *
 * Built on tests/support/sweep-kit.ts — `listSourceFiles` for the walk,
 * `stripSource` for comment/string masking, `auditRegistry` for
 * exempted-with-a-reason plus stale-exemption and dead-scan floors. Those
 * floors are the point: this repo's catalog shape 10 is a sweep that matches
 * nothing and reads as clean.
 *
 * Scope: the shipped source tree (clients/, index.ts, tools/, mcp/). Tests and
 * scripts are out — neither runs on pi's event loop.

 *
 * `safeSpawn` has TWO internal `spawnSync` fallback calls that both spread

 * (#2487 review round 3 F1): a prior version keyed both on that shared
 * spread and disambiguated the collision by SCAN POSITION (`key`, `key#2`).
 * Position is not identity — inserting a new unbounded call between the two
 * exempted ones shifts every ordinal after it, so a reviewed reason rides
 * the WRONG call site while the new, unreviewed one either reds with no
 * file:line to act on, or rides an existing ordinal and ships silently
 * (round 3 probes 1 and 2, both proved against this file pre-fix). The fix
 * is a snippet unique to each call's own arguments — no ordinal, no
 * position-dependence: the Windows-resolved-path branch destructures into
 * `spawnCmd, spawnArgs`, the plain-command branch carries a comment no other
 * call shares. Each snippet occurs in exactly one call's argument list, so a
 * THIRD colliding call (a new site that also happens to match one of these
 * snippets) still cannot ride an existing entry — see `exemptionKey`.
